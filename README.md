# 🛒 Quantium Retail Analytics Case Study – Chips Category

This repository contains a detailed retail analytics project performed on chip sales data from Quantium, simulating a real-world data analytics scenario. The project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior, store performance, and the impact of a trial layout strategy.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Quantium_Task1.ipynb` – Data exploration, merging, and cleaning
- `Quantium_Task2.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and segmentation based on customer profiles
- `Quantium_Task 3.pdf` – Business presentation summarizing findings and recommendations
- `QVI_transaction_data.csv` – Transactional data with product and customer purchase details
- `QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv` – Customer demographic segmentation
- `QVI_data.csv` – Product metadata (e.g., product names, brands)

## 🔍 Objectives

1. **Clean & merge datasets** to create a reliable base for analysis
2. **Understand customer behavior** through life stage and affluence segmentation
3. **Analyze total chip sales** across time and customer types
4. **Evaluate trial store layout performance** to assess its business impact
5. **Generate actionable insights** for business decisions

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Customer Segmentation**: Mainstream and older customer segments purchased the most chips; affluence didn't significantly affect chip sales.
- **Trial Store Analysis**:
  - Store 77 showed sustained sales increase post-trial → Positive impact of new layout.
  - Stores 86 & 88 returned to normal levels → Suggests temporary improvement.
- **Recommendation**: Roll out layout to more stores with ongoing evaluation.

## 💼 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint-style presentation (PDF)
- Excel (for raw data files)
